# PythonProject_01
This project analyzes video game sales from a 2016 dataset containing 11 variables (7 numerical, 4 categorical). The objective is to transform the data by: comparing the average global sales before and after 2005, creating a new column that categorizes records as “pre-2005” or “post-2005". 
The analysis is performed using **Python**, leveraging **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:  
- Python 3.x installed  
- Required libraries: **Pandas, NumPy**

- ### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/keithokeans/PythonProject_01.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd PythonProject_01
3. Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy

4. ## Running the Code
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Project1_Group5.ipynb`).  
2. Run the first few cells to load the dataset (`vgsales.csv`).  
3. Follow the transformations performed to analyze pre- and post-2005 sales trends.

## Running the Tests
### Breakdown of Tests
- The script checks whether **average sales before 2005** and **after 2005** are significantly different.  
- A new column is created to classify records into "pre-2005" and "post-2005".  
- Missing or incorrect data is handled in the preprocessing step.

## Deployment
This project is designed for **local execution** in a Jupyter Notebook.
